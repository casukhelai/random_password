# random_password: Homework #3
## Ishya Casukhela

## Description
This homework we were tasked to create a random password generator where the user can choose whatever criteria (password length, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters) they would like in their password. This project uses one function that throws some error messages if the initial criteria is not met and the criteria is given in a series of alerts.

From this homework I was able to learn how:
- to effectively write a while loop and using boolean logic
- to utilize the independent nature of if statements to condense the 24 different outcomes into 4 statements
- to use Math.floor and Math.random to store the chosen criteria in an array and RANDOMLY choose from that array based on the length the user has chosen.
